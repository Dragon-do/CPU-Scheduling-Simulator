# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
We as a group of 2nd year B-Tech Students made a CPU Scheduling Simulator for our Operating System Project to showcase our skills in the particular domain.

1. Introduction: 
Effective Central Processing Unit (CPU) management is essential for optimum system 
responsiveness, throughput, and performance in contemporary operating systems. CPU 
scheduling has a direct impact on important performance indicators like system fairness, 
waiting time, and response time. The goal of this project, the CPU Scheduling Simulator, 
is to model and assess the behaviour of different CPU scheduling algorithms in an engaging 
and instructive setting. The simulator gives users useful, hands-on insight by letting them 
define processes and see how scheduling strategies like FCFS, Round Robin, and Priority 
Scheduling distribute the CPU. The goal of the tool is to close the knowledge gap between 
abstract theoretical concepts and the practical performance effects of various resource 
management strategies. 
2. Objectives: 
i) Execute and thoroughly evaluate a variety of common and sophisticated CPU 
scheduling algorithms. 
ii) Create a user interface that is responsive and easy to use so that process 
parameters can be entered clearly and results can be show. 
iii) Use dynamic Gantt charts to visualise the CPU allocation sequence and execution 
flow. 
iv) To analyze the performance of the implemented algorithms by measuring CPU 
utilization, turnaround time, response time, and waiting time for better evaluation. 
v) Create a polished project report, thorough documentation, and presentation 
materials that are appropriate for scholarly assessment.
